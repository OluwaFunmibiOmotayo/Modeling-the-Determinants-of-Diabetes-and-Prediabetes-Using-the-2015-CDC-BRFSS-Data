# Background and analysis objectives

Diabetes is a serious chronic health condition that occurs when the blood sugar (glucose) is high because the body has lost the ability to process and use food effectively. When food is consumed, it is broken down into glucose during digestion and then released into the bloodstream which signals the pancreas to produce the hormone insulin that allows the conversion of the food into usable energy. However, in individuals with diabetes, the process is hindered as the pancreases does not produce enough insulin, or the body is unable to use it properly. As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed by the cells for energy. This health condition poses a serious threat to health in the 21st century. According to (Winer & Sowers, 2013), with diabetes comes an increased risk of stroke, heart/kidney failure, birth complications, sexual dysfunction, limb amputations, and the common risk factors associated with diabetes include obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia.

This disease is a growing global health issue that affects about 463 million adults worldwide and is projected to rise to 700 million by 2045 (Gao, 2025). According to the center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes is part of the leading top 10 causes of death in the United States, about 38.4 million Americans (11.6% of the United State population) currently have diabetes, 29.7 million have been diagnosed, while 8.7 million (22.8%) are unaware that they have diabetes. Also, 97.6 million people aged 18 years or older (38% of the United State population) have prediabetes, a condition that significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Of the total prevalence of Prediabetes, approximately 27.2 million (48.8%) of older adults aged 65 years and above are living with this condition (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2024).

This project aims to analyze how demographic characteristics, health behaviors, mental and physical health status, cardiovascular comorbidities and healthcare access contributes to the risk of diabetes and prediabetes using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey dataset.

# Data description and data cleaning

**Data Description**

The diabetes health indicators dataset that was used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is originally gotten from the CDC’S 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) but has been cleaned. The BRFSS is a cross-sectional telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments on over 400, 000 Americans to collect data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. The 2015 BRFSS dataset has 441,455 individuals and 330 features, these features contain questions in the survey and others that were automatically generated based on respondents’ response. This project used the diabetes \_ 012 \_ health \_ indicators \_ BRFSS2015 dataset. It is a clean dataset of 253,680 individual responses and includes 21 features variables with the target variable Diabetes_012 which has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 for prediabetes, and 2 for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset, and the predictor variables are listed below (Table 1)

**Data Cleaning**

The dataset was already cleaned and has no missing variable. However, factor encoding was done on the categorical independent and dependent variables, appropriate names were given to the levels and variables were converted to factor and ordinal as appropriate. The response variable has three levels namely no diabetes or only during pregnancy, prediabetes, and diabetes, we created another variable called diabetes_binary that has no diabetes or only during pregnancy as a level and both prediabetes, and diabetes as another level.

# Exploratory data analysis through numeric summary and/or graphs

Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics (Sex, age, education and household income) of respondents stratified by diabetes status (No diabetes, Prediabetes, and Diabetes). Each of these variables are summarized using counts and percentage. A Pearson’s Chi-square test was conducted to determine if the demographic variable differs across diabetes status. Overall, 84.24% of the respondents reported no diabetes, 1.83% were prediabetes and 13.93% had diabetes. More of the respondents were female (56%) than males (44%), and respondents between the age of 35 and 80+ have more than 5% of the total sample in their respective category. Nearly half of the respondents were college graduate (42%) and 36% reported annual household income of \$75k or higher. A Pearson Chi-squared test and a one-way Anova was conducted to determine if randomization was balanced between the groups, however all results were significant indicating that the randomization is not balanced and we would have to adjust for covariate in the analysis.

Figures 1 shows the distribution of diabetes status across age groups and Figure 2 shows the rate of diabetes/prediabetes by age group and sex. The stacked bar chart (Figure 1) shows that the proportion of individuals with diabetes and prediabetes increases steadily with age but reduced at age 75 and above. With figure 2, we observed that both males and females shows an increasing rate of diabetes and prediabetes with age; however, males generally show slightly higher rates across most age categories, particularly between ages 40 and 80+.

Figure 3 below shows the heatmap of the rate of diabetes across education level and household income. The plot showed that lower income and lower household income is associated with high diabetes and prediabetes rate across respondents. We saw that respondents who never attended school or only kindergarten and those with elementary education whose household income is less than or equal to \$15,000 show diabetes rates exceeding 40% compared to some college or college graduate who have the same household income. As both education and income level increase, diabetes prevalence decreases consistently, this shows the impact of these two variables on respondents’ health outcome.

Table 2 shows the distribution of health behaviors, mental and physical health indicators, cardiovascular comorbidities, and healthcare access across individuals with no diabetes, prediabetes, and diabetes. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s Chi-squared test, while continuous variables were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to evaluate differences across diabetes status groups.

Overall, 43% of respondents reported having high blood pressure, and 42% had high cholesterol, but these two conditions were prevalent among those with diabetes and prediabetes. The mean BMI increased across groups, from 28 among non-diabetic participants to 32 among those with diabetes.

Figures 3 and 4 shows the compounding effects of multiple metabolic and lifestyle risk factors specifically high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, smoking, and obesity (BMI \> 30) on diabetes prevalence, as well as the moderating role of physical activity across different risk levels.

The number of risk factor was obtained by counting the number of times all the five conditions (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, smoking, and obesity (BMI \> 30)) appear in each of the diabetes status level. As shown in the plot, the prevalence of diabetes increases as the number of risk factor present increases. For participants with no identified risk factors, only about 2% have diabetes and 1% are prediabetes, 97% do not have diabetes. We observed that the proportion of those who have diabetes increase to 52% for participants who has all the 5 number of risk present.

For Figure 4, the metabolic risk level was gotten using the following.

-   Very High Risk: Respondents with both high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a BMI greater than 30

-   High Risk: Respondents with either high blood pressure or high cholesterol, and a BMI greater than 30.

-   Moderate Risk: Respondents with high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, or BMI \> 30. Low Risk: Respondents with none of these risk indicators.

The result showed that exercise physical activity decreases the rate of diabetes across different risk level. This shows exercise could be helpful in reducing the risk of diabetes across respondents.

# Statistical inferences

To understand the various predictors of diabetes status, this project used two statistical methods: Logistic regression and Baseline category Logit model. The response variable initially had three categories: No diabetes (n = 213,703), Prediabetes (4,631) and Diabetes (35,346). For the binary logistic model, both the prediabetes and diabetes levels were combined to form a single level named “Diabetes”, which result in a binary response variable (No diabetes = 0, Diabetes = 1). The Baseline category Logit model however retained the three categories to fit the model.

**Multiple Logistic Regression**

The multiple Logistic regression method was used as it models the relationship between a binary outcome variable and multiple explanatory variables (both continuous and categorical). Since we already created a binary outcome variable (No diabetes = 0, Prediabetes/Diabetes = 1), then a multiple logistic regression can be used to estimate the odds of having prediabetes/diabetes with respect to regressors such as Demographic, Body Mass Index, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Smoking, Health General and Mental Health, Chronic Health Conditions, Health Care, Physical Activity, Diet, and Alcohol Consumption. This project used a purposeful selection of the explanatory variables by including the main effects and variables were retained based on statistical significance, their role as a potential confounder and their importance to the study using a backward elimination stepwise algorithm. The multiple logistic regression has the form: $$\footnotesize
\begin{aligned}
\text{Logit}\big(P(Y=1)\big) 
&= \log\left(\frac{P(Y=\text{Prediabetes/Diabetes})}{P(Y=\text{No Diabetes})}\right) \\
&= \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k
\end{aligned}
$$

**Baseline Category Logit Model**

A baseline category logit model is a generalization of the logistic regression to multiple nominal categories. It assumes the response variable follows a multinomial distribution and since our dataset initially has three categories (diabetes, Prediabetes and Diabetes), we use this model to fit the data based on the same regressor as used with Logistic regression.

This model has c − 1 = 3 − 1 = 2 equations, corresponding to comparisons as shown in the equation below

$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_{\text{Diabetes}}}{\pi_{\text{No Diabetes}}}\right)
= \alpha_{\text{D}} + \beta_{1\text{D}} X_1 + \beta_{2\text{D}} X_2 + \cdots + \beta_{k\text{D}} X_k
$$

$$
\log\left(\frac{\pi_{\text{Prediabetes}}}{\pi_{\text{No Diabetes}}}\right)
= \alpha_{\text{P}} + \beta_{1\text{P}} X_1 + \beta_{2\text{P}} X_2 + \cdots + \beta_{k\text{P}} X_k
$$

This model was selected to extend the multiple binary logistic models so that we can have the three response categories in the model. This model allows us to separately compare for prediabetes and diabetes.

# Model inference, knowledge discovery, and discussion.

**What did you learn about the data and experiments?**

The dataset contained a large and diverse sample of participants (n ≈ 253,680) with information on demographic, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics. The response variable captured three levels of diabetes status which are: No diabetes (213,703), Prediabetes (4,631), and Diabetes (35,346).

Among the regressors, four were ordinal in nature: GenHlth, Age, Education, and Income. To determine the most appropriate way to model these ordered variables, two logistic regression models were compared: 1) treating the above four variables in a quantitative manner, 2) treating them in a categorical manner. The result from both comparison (LRT Statistic: 1340, df = 24, p \< 0.001) showed that treating these variables as a factor fit better than treating it in a quantitative manner, thus for other modelling, these regressors were used as a factor.

**Relationship between response and predictors.**

**Logistic Regression**

A multiple logistic regression was conducted to determine the association between diabetes status (prediabetes/diabetes vs. no diabetes) and regressors such as regressors such as Demographic, Body Mass Index, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Smoking, Health General and Mental Health, Chronic Health Conditions, Health Care, Physical Activity, Diet, and Alcohol Consumption. Two models were compared: 1) Main effect only and 2) Main effect with some selected predictors. The result from both comparison (LRT Statistic: 609.35, df = 52, p \< 0.001) showed that the model with the interaction fits better and thus was used.

**Interaction Effects**

*Note: Only significant interaction is reported here.*

**BMI:Age:** The effect of BMI on diabetes risk increases with age. Each extra BMI point matters more at older age. A 5-unit BMI increase at age 70 has a stronger diabetes effect than at age 25.

**Main Effects**

*Note: Only significant main effect not associated with any significant interaction effect is reported here.*

**Key Health Predictors**

-   High blood pressure ($\beta$ = 0.68, p \< .001), and Cholesterol checked in the past 5 years ($\beta$ = 1.17, p \< .001), were strong positive predictors. This shows that the odds of having prediabetes/diabetes for individuals with high blood pressure is 1.97 times that of those who does not have high blood pressure. Also, the odd of having prediabetes/diabetes for individuals who had their Cholesterol checked in the past 5 years is 3.19 times those who did not check in the last 5 years.

Chronic Health Conditions

-   History of stroke (Ever told you have a stroke, ($\beta$ = 0.14, p \< .001)) and heart disease or attack (Ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI), ($\beta$ = 0.47, p \< .001)) were also significant risk factors.

Diet

-   The odds of prediabetes/diabetes ($\beta$ = -0.02, p =0.08) for Individuals who consume fruit 1 or more times per day is 0.98 times those who do not consume fruit 1 or more times per day.

-   The odds of prediabetes/diabetes ($\beta$ = -0.03, p =0.04) for Individuals who consume vegetables one or more times per day is 0.97 times those who do not consume fruit 1 or more times per day.

Health Care

-   Those who reported not seeing a doctor because of cost have about 4% higher odds of diabetes ($\beta$ = 0.04, p =0.08).

General and Mental Health

-   Having a serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs is positively associated with diabetes ($\beta$ = 0.12, p \< .001).

-   The number of days during the past 30 days for which individual mental health was not good showed a nonsignificant negative association with the likelihood of diabetes, ($\beta$ = -0.001, p =.13).

Demographics

-   The odds of having prediabetes/diabetes for individuals with Income \$75k+ ($\beta$ = -0.42, p \< .001), \$50k-\$75k ($\beta$ = -0.28, p \< .001), \$35k-\$50k ($\beta$ = -0.24, p \< .001), \$25k-\$35k ($\beta$ = -0.16, p \< .001), \$20k-\$25k ($\beta$ = -0.09, p = .004), \$15k-\$20k ($\beta$ = -0.06, p = .06), \$10k-\$15k ($\beta$ = -0.018, p = .59), is 0.66, 0.76, 0.79, 0.85, 0.91, 0.94, 0.98 times those with income \<\$10k respectively. This means that people with household income of \$75k+ have 34% lower odds of having diabetes compared to those with income less than \$10k.

**Baseline Category Logit Model**

A baseline category logit model was conducted to determine the association between diabetes, prediabetes vs. no diabetes. A separate model was created for the response diabetes vs. no diabetes, and prediabetes vs. diabetes. Two models were compared: 1) Main effect only and 2) Main effect with some selected predictors. The result from both comparison (LRT Statistic: 676.73, df = 108, p \< 0.001) showed that the model with the interaction fits better and thus was used.

# What are the pros and cons of these methods?

The logistic regression model has several advantages: it achieves a lower AIC, indicating a better fit, uses fewer parameters and is therefore more powerful, and provides simpler interpretations. However, a key limitation is that it reduces the outcome to a binary classification, causing specific information about the prediabetes stage to be lost.

In contrast, the baseline category logit model captures the prediabetes stage and offers a more comprehensive analysis. Its drawbacks include a higher AIC, meaning a worse fit, the use of more parameters (making it less powerful), and a more complex interpretation.

# Is there any interesting discovery from your analysis?

Several interesting discoveries was found in the result. Based on the model with the best fit,

-   The effect of diabetes/prediabetes risk became more pronounced in older age groups. At age 18 to 24 years, increase in BMI only increases the risk of diabetes by 2.5% but this increases to 7.1% for those aged 80 years and above suggesting that older people must pay more and closer attention to their weight to reduce their risk of diabetes. Weight management is important in diabetes prevention among older adults.

-   There was a reversal in the effect of gender on the risk of diabetes as age increases. At age 18-24, males have about 41% lower odds of diabetes compared to females; however, this effect diminishes as age increases. This could suggest possible shift in body composition or hormonal changes, or how they pay attention to their health.

-   Also, as the number of days during the past 30 days for which the respondent’s physical health not good increases, diabetes/prediabetes risk only increases among those with very good and excellent general health while the risk reduces with those who have poor or fair general health. This suggests that physical health reduction has more effect on the risk of diabetes for people who good and excellent general health compared to those whose health are already bad.

-   Having both high cholesterol and heart diseases doubles the odds of diabetes.

-   BMI has a stronger effect on diabetes risk among physical active people compared to inactive people which is counterintuitive.

# Conclusions

This project analyze how demographic characteristics, health behaviors, mental and physical health status, cardiovascular comorbidities and healthcare access contributes to the risk of diabetes and prediabetes using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey dataset using two modelling approach (Logistic Regression and Baseline category logit model). The result of both models was compared using AIC with Logistics regression performing better than the baseline category logit model even though the baseline model models take into consideration the three categories of the response (prediabetes, diabetes and no diabetes).

Overall, the Logistic model shows the influences of both demographics and other clinical predictors of diabetes/prediabetes. The influence of BMI on diabetes/prediabetes increases with age, suggesting that more focus should be placed on adults with higher weights. Patients with combination of high cholesterol and heart disease should be paid keen attention as both effect doubles the odds of diabetes/prediabetes. We also saw that, differences in diabetes/prediabetes reverses with age suggesting changes in physical, behavioral or health lifestyle which could further be invested in the next phase of the analysis. We also saw that the risk of diabetes/prediabetes has more influence on those whose general health status is good but has an increased number of days for which their physical health was not good.

Together, this project was able to select the best model and determine the factors that could affect prediabetes and diabetes risk among people.
